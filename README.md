Tic-Tac-Toe game built in React.js by following the tutorial at [react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

At the end of tutorial there's was *some ideas for improvements*, here what I added from those ideas for improvements:
1. For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button. ✔

2. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. ✔

3. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order. ✔

4. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw). ✔

#### TODO:

- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
- Add to README.md file video that showing result. (optional)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
